This third version of the `Chatbot` class builds on the previous agentic versions but introduces **vector database integration** to **store and retrieve embeddings of chat content**, making the chatbot more context-aware and memory-rich over time.

---

## üîç What This Chatbot Does

### 1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**
- Similar setup with OpenAI, config, session, and database managers.
- Adds a new component:
  - `VectorDBManager`: Manages a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone, etc.) used for embedding-based search and memory updates.
- Updates the list of agent-callable functions to include:
  - `add_user_info_to_database`
  - `search_vector_db` (replaces or complements earlier `search_chat_history`)

---

### 2. **Function Execution (`execute_function_call`)**
- Executes functions called by the LLM.
- Now supports vector DB search via `search_vector_db`.

---

### 3. **Conversational Loop (`chat`)**
- Same **agentic loop** approach as the second version:
  - Handles function calls, tracks history and function call results, enforces a function call limit.
- Uses an updated system prompt builder: `prepare_system_prompt_for_agentic_chatbot_v2`, which likely tailors the prompt for vector-aware capabilities.

### 4. **New VectorDB Update**
- After the assistant sends a final response, the user-assistant message pair is **converted into a single string** and stored in the vector DB:
  ```python
  msg_pair = f"user: {user_message}, assistant: {assistant_response}"
  self.vector_db_manager.update_vector_db(msg_pair)
  ```
- This lets the chatbot **"remember" past conversations semantically** and use that memory later.

| **Tools** | None | `add_user_info_to_database`, `search_chat_history` | `add_user_info_to_database`, `search_vector_db` |
| **Search Capability** | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Semantic chat history search | ‚úÖ Vector database search |
| **Memory System** | Chat + summary | Chat + summary | Chat + summary + **long-term memory (vector DB)** |
| **System Prompt** | `prepare_system_prompt` | `prepare_system_prompt_for_agentic_chatbot_v1` | `...v2` with vector support context |
| **Knowledge Retention** | Temporary, short-term | Contextually limited | **Semantically indexed for long-term reasoning** |

## üß† Summary

This third version transforms the chatbot into a **hybrid conversational agent** with:
- Multi-turn reasoning via OpenAI tools
- Real-time database interaction
- **Long-term memory** via vector embeddings

This enables the chatbot to not only perform actions but also **grow smarter over time**, remember past conversations in a meaningful way, and retrieve relevant information using **semantic similarity** rather than just string matches. It's a big step toward creating an intelligent assistant that learns and adapts.
